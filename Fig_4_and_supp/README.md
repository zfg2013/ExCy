# Reproducing Figure 4 and associated supplementary files

1. Please extract all the gz files in the directory to their root. As an example Healthy.tar.gz should be extracted to produce the
   folder "Healthy" in the directory.

2. Inside of the TCGA folder, please download the entire gz file and extract from this dropbox link:
   https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8z6noxxkpwz3fukrmp2wj/h?rlkey=wdbfm19rqzlen05sauv6yb5db&dl=0

3. Afterwards, each notebook contains the code used to analyze and generate the main or supplementary figure.
