## Peptide-based capture-and-release purification of extracellular vesicles and statistical algorithm enabled quality assessment 

link: 

In our publication, we developed a statistical metric called the ExoQuality Index (EQI) that measures extracellular vesicle homogeneity when given a dataframe containing experimental characterization. Furthermore, this repository also contains the notebook and code to generate each figure from R or Python. 

## The ExoQuality Index:
To utilize the ExoQuality Index, please go inside the ExoQuality Index folder and read the instructions to use as you will. 

## Reproducing each figure from R or Python
Please check the README in each folder to reproduce the figure.
