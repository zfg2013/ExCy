## Capture-release-purification of extracellular vesicles with quality index strategy for discovering circulating pancreatic tumor biomarkers - link: 

In our publication, we developed a statistical metric called the ExoQuality Index (EQI) that measures extracellular vesicle homogeneity when given a dataframe containing experimental characterization. Furthermore, this repository also contains the notebook and code to generate each figure from R or Python. 

## The ExoQuality Index:
To utilize the ExoQuality Index, please follow these instructions:

## Reproducing each figure from R or Python
Please check the README in each folder to reproduce the figure.
