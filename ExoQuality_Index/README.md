## ExoQuality Index External Operation: 

In our publication, we developed a statistical metric called the ExoQuality Index (EQI) that measures extracellular vesicle homogeneity when given a dataframe containing experimental characterization. To use the EQI calculation externally, please do the following:
```
1. Download this folder
```
```
2. Put your data into this folder as a CSV file
  a. Your data structure should be samples (rows) by parameters (columns) with an additional isolation identifier column
  b. a toy example has been provided in this folder as an example
```
```
3. Run the python script using python EQI.py 
```
